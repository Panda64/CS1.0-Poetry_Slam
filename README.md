# Poetry-Slam
 
 This is a Poetry Slam program writtin in Python 3.7.9 that takes a poem from a file and can manipulate it in a few different ways.

 Upon running the program, the user will be able to select what they would like to do to the poem that is already provided (The peom is called Monosyllabics by Laura E. Richards). Below is the selection menu that the user will see, which pretty well sums up what this program can do to a poem:

1. The poem will be printed normally 
2. The peom will be printed in reverse (line wise) 
3. The peom will be printed randomlly (line wise)
4. The two halves of each line will be swapped in position 
   (Example: 'Hey how are you' will become 'are you? Hey how')

In order to select an option, the user will type in the corresponding number of what they want to do. Once the user has selected an option, it will then print out that version of the poem. This process will keep repeating until the user types 'stop' (This is explained in the introductory message).

This is currently the extent of my Poetry Slam program.
